# Diary.com
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop and deploy a cloud-based diary-writing web platform application. The app will allow users to write personal entries to themselves or to share their thoughts with the public via their profile. Entries can be locked with passwords or encryption so that no one but the user can access what they write. Users can also share access with other people via email for collaborative entries.

## Features
1. **Personalized Profile UI:** Users can select a theme for a simple interface that allows them to rename/delete/share their entries in a Google style but with an emphasis on privacy for intimate diary entries.

2. **Writing UI:** Opening entries transfer to a different editing UI for writing entries. Entries can be shared with other users via email so that they can also collaborate. Entries are not strictly limited to diary entries, as users can also use the interface to write poems, fiction, etc.

4. **Privacy:** The website emphasizes the importance of user privacy for intimate entries. Locked or private entries cannot be accessed by anyone except the user. Public entries can be seen by others and if any concerning content should arise, users may report the entry-writer for content violation.
